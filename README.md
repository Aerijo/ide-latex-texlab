# Requirements

Requires
- the Texlab server be installed already. You must provide an absolute path to the executable in settings, and ensure execution permissions are enabled. If building from the GitHub repo, the path might look something like
```
/<path to repo>/texlab/build/libs/texlab.jar
```

- The requirements [listed here](https://texlab.netlify.com/docs#requirements)

See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/efoerster/texlab#getting-started) for how to build the server.

PR's to improve installation instructions / automate it welcome.

This package is not affiliated with Texlab, it is just a client for their language server.
